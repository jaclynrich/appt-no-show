# Exploratory and Statistical Analysis of Doctor Appointment No-Shows
***

In this project, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized a data set of over 110K doctor's appointments in Vit√≥ria, Brazil provided by JoniHoppen on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).  Univariate and bivariate plots and analysis were employed in Python.  Chi-square tests were used to confirm which attributes are most associated with patients not showing up for appointments.  This analysis will eventually be used to create a model to predict whether or not a patient will show up to an appointment.
